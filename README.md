# BeanBot ☕🤖  
**Smart Coffee Delivery Robot**  
*KAUST IED 230 – Agile Product Development & Corporate Innovation*  
Developed under the KAUST Smart initiative | Spring 2023

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BeanBot** is a smart, semi-autonomous coffee delivery robot aimed at optimizing coffee service within workplace environments. Designed and developed during the *IED 230* course at KAUST, this project addresses key challenges in traditional café operations—such as long wait times and inefficient delivery—by combining innovative robotics with intuitive software.

## 💡 The Challenge

Modern workspaces face a number of productivity hurdles when it comes to coffee delivery:
- ❌ Long waiting lines at campus cafés
- ❌ Office locations distant from coffee stations
- ❌ Baristas spending time on delivery rather than preparation

These inefficiencies impact customer satisfaction, employee productivity, and business scalability.

## ✅ Our Solution

**BeanBot** is a two-part system:

### 🤖 Robusta – The Hardware
A mobile robot equipped with:
- Autonomous navigation capabilities
- Obstacle avoidance sensors
- Pressure sensors to detect payload
- Facial recognition and barcode scanning
- Modular, customizable shelving

### 📲 BeanBot – The Software
A cross-platform application offering:
- A user-friendly interface for customers to place orders
- An order management panel for baristas
- Real-time communication between robot and café systems
